# AuraWork: Your Complete Workspace

**AuraWork** is a suite of private, lightweight, and powerful tools meticulously designed to boost your productivity with Material Design elegance.

Developed by **Mashiyath Ilias**, this project provides a focused, cohesive, and beautiful workspace, running entirely in the browser.

## 🔒 Privacy Commitment

**We prioritize user privacy above all else.**

> **Privacy focused.** No data leaves your device (except for *AuraChat*, if you choose to use it).

All core application data for **AuraWord, AuraSheet, AuraPad, AuraCalc, and AuraDate** is stored locally in your browser (LocalStorage/IndexedDB), ensuring your work remains entirely yours.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

AuraWork is built entirely with **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. Since it is a static web application, running it locally is simple and requires no complex backend configuration.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mashiyathilias-code/Mateord-.git
cd Mateord-
```

### 2. Run Locally

**Option A: Quick Start**
Simply navigate to the folder and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

**Option B: Recommended (Local Server)**
For the best experience and to avoid browser security restrictions (especially when developing), use a simple local HTTP server (e.g., Python's built-in server):

```bash
# Python 3
python -m http.server
```

Once running, access the application at the resulting local URL (usually `http://localhost:8000`).
