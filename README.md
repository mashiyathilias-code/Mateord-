AuraWork: Your Complete Workspace

✨ Description

AuraWork is a suite of private, lightweight, and powerful tools meticulously designed to boost your productivity with Material Design elegance.

Developed by Mashiyath Ilias, this project provides a focused, cohesive, and beautiful workspace, running entirely in the browser.

🔒 Privacy Commitment

We prioritize user privacy above all else.

Privacy focused. No data leaves your device (except for AuraChat, if you choose to use it). All core application data for AuraWord, AuraSheet, AuraPad, AuraCalc, and AuraDate is stored locally in your browser, ensuring your work remains entirely yours.

🚀 The AuraWork Suite

AuraWork bundles five core applications, each crafted to enhance a specific area of your productivity.

AuraWord 📄: A rich text document writer with full formatting controls, printing capabilities, and local file saving.

AuraSheet 📊: Organize data with rows and columns. Features include CSV export and formula support.

AuraPad 📝: A distraction-free notepad with character counting and reliable auto-save functionality.

AuraCalc ➕: Perform quick calculations with a clean, history-tracking interface.

AuraDate 📅: Manage your schedule, add events, and track important dates visually.

🛠️ Installation & Setup

AuraWork is built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Since it's a static web application, running it locally is simple and requires no complex backend configuration.

Clone the Repository:

git clone [https://github.com/mashiyathilias-code/Mateord-.git](https://github.com/mashiyathilias-code/Mateord-.git)
cd Mateord-



Run Locally:

Quick Start: Simply open the index.html file in your web browser.

Recommended: For the best experience and to avoid browser security restrictions (especially when developing), use a simple local HTTP server (e.g., Python's built-in server):

# Python 3
python -m http.server



Access the application at the resulting local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8000).
